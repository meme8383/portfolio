        {`I'm Eduard Tanase, a senior at Purdue in Computer Engineering. My projects bounce between full-stack development, computational neuroscience, and embedded systems.
        I build websites like PointOrchard, a credit card comparison site that hit 2,000+ visitors in under a month, and ECELabs, a digital design platform used by every Computer Engineering student at Purdue.
        In my research, I develop machine learning models to interpret mouse brain signals. I enjoy working on challenging projects and learning new things, as well as pursuing hobbies like playing guitar, cooking, and gaming.`}
